<p>Australia is situated to the south-east part of southern part of Asia. A lot of people thinks that Australia is a continent itself, but that’s not true.

<p>The highest peak is <strong>Mt. Kosciusko</strong> (2200 cca), the longest river: <strong>Murray</strong> (2000+km).
The big part of central and west Australia consist of deserts of half-deserts. That’s why most of 25 mil. people living here live on east coast where the climate is similair to ours.  Here are also located the most biggest cities.

Queen is represented by Governor-General. With advice of Prime Minister appoint ministers. This guy has similair duties like our president so he is de facto head of state. 
The Prime Minister (<strong>Scott Morrison</strong>) is a chef of government and is responsible for the Parliaments.
Parliament has in Australia legislative role (can make and change laws). It is divided into <strong>Senate</strong>  (upper house) and <strong>House of Representative</strong> (lower house).
