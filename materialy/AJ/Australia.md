##	Geography
### Location:
Australia is situated to the south-east part of southern part of Asia. A lot of people thinks that Australia is a continent itself, but that’s not true. 
Australian continet include also New Guinea and Indonesia.
_Australia is separated from Asian continent by Timor sea (on north) and by the Tasman Sea from New Zealand. And in genereal is sorounded by Indian ocean._
### Landscape:
The highest peak is **Mt. Kosciusko** (2200 cca), the longest river: **Murray** (2000+km).
The big part of central and west Australia consist of deserts of half-deserts. That’s why most of 25 mil. people living here live on east coast where the climate is similair to ours.  Here are also located the most biggest cities.

### Climate:
Australia is universally affected by ocean, including phenomenom called **El Nino** which have been causing dry season.
Except eastern part of Australia, where we can find most rivers and lakes, the rest sufferes from rain lack.Almost **70% of Australia has absence of water** what makes Australian the worst conditions from all other continents.
##	Politics 
 Australia is divided into **six states + 2 territories**. It is a part of _Commonwealth_ so the formal head is a British queen – **Elizabeth II**. It’s only formal so they have their own Parliament and Government 
Queen is represented by Governor-General. With advice of Prime Minister appoint ministers. This guy has similair duties like our president so he is de facto head of state. 
The Prime Minister (**Scott Morrison**) is a chef of government and is responsible for the Parliaments.
Parliament has in Australia legislative role (can make and change laws). It is divided into **Senate**  (upper house) and **House of Representative** (lower house). 
The executive role has The Government. Each minister is appointed by Governor-General on advise from PM.
